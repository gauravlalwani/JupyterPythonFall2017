    "A mini-hackathon is a group programming project by a team of 2-4 students. Two class periods will be devoted for each mini-hackathon. Students will be given a list of problems to be addressed prior to a mini-hackathon, and each student will choose a topic of interest. Those selecting the same topic will be organized into a team. The size of each team will be 2-4 students; if there are any uneven distribution distributions of students, the instructor will merge / split teams into appropriate sizes. The teams will then work on the problem they are assigned during the Day 1 of the hackathon. On the Day 2 of the hackathon, each team will demonstrate their code in a brief group presentation."

    "  1. **Brute-force password cracking** Students will attempt to crack passwords by generating all possible combinations of letters and numbers, and try them one by one.\n",
    "  2. **Pig-Latin translator** Students will write a program that translates a simple English text into Pig-Latin.\n",
    "  3. **Roman numeral converter** Students will code algorithms to convert a number into a Roman numeral, and vice versa.\n",
    "  4. **Word frequency counter** Students will write a program to count the number of occurrences of different words in a long text.\n",

If there are teams with too few or too many students, then the instructor will re-assign students. Although the students' preference will be taken into consideration, the final team assignment will be determined by the instructor. The team assignment will be presented at the beginning of the hackathon."
